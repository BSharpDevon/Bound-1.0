<p>
Create a design wireframe of your project: <br>
● Decide on how many screens you will need to produce and the flow expected
for your user to follow <br>
o Make sure you have a minimum of 4 screens<br>
o Make sure you create a wireframe for each screen you are planning to
have and explain the flow expected for your users to follow (illustrate
how one leads to the other? e.g., an arrow going from one to the other) <br>
● Submit quick summary justification for your design choices <br>
o Are any good, are any bad? Why did you place x in y position <br>
o Make sure that there are some colours - add justification for the
colours used
