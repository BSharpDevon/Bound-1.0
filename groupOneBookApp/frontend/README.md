# Bound

### Introduction

Bound is a web application that simplifies book selection for pairs of users by blending their literary preferences into tailored recommendations. Unlike existing apps, Bound uniquely focuses on shared interests, addressing the challenge of finding mutually enjoyable books for friends, families, or book clubs. The app features user-friendly functionalities such as adding friends, creating "binds" for personalized suggestions, and purchasing books via affiliate links.

Developed collaboratively using agile methodologies, React.js, Node.js, and APIs like Google Books, Bound integrates high-contrast design and accessibility.

Documentation is included within the folder.
